# Cinema 4Dâ€”How to Randomly Place Images as Textures on Clones Without Duplication
 
I was struggling to to figure out a solution for how to apply texture images to clones without any overlap / duplication of the texture images. I had exactly the same amount of clones as I did texture images. All of the information I was able to find via Google search was incomplete or incorrect. It took piecing together information from several different tutorial videos to find a solution that works. I hope this video can save someone else time and frustration in the future.
